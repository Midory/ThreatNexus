1. Define Objectives & Requirements
Goals:

Aggregate data from multiple threat intelligence sources.
Correlate aggregated data with your application assets.
Provide risk scoring and prioritization for vulnerabilities.
Display insights via a dashboard for easy consumption.
Key Questions:

What types of threats or vulnerabilities will you focus on (e.g., CVEs, malware indicators, phishing domains)?
Which threat feeds will you integrate (e.g., NVD, CVE feeds, AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch)?
Who is the target audience (e.g., security teams, developers)?
2. Identify and Integrate Threat Intelligence Sources
Public Sources:

NVD/CVE Feeds: Official vulnerability databases.
Security Mailing Lists/Advisories: E.g., US-CERT.
Open Source APIs: AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch, etc.
Private/Commercial Feeds (if applicable):

Consider integrating paid services for more comprehensive data.
Integration:

Create connectors or adapters for each feed to fetch data (using REST APIs, RSS feeds, etc.).
3. Design the System Architecture
Data Ingestion Layer:

Use scheduled jobs or real-time streaming (e.g., with Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) to collect data.
Normalize the incoming data into a consistent schema.
Data Storage:

Consider a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexibility or a relational database if your data structure is well defined.
Use an indexing system like Elasticsearch for quick searching and aggregation.
Processing & Correlation Engine:

Develop a service (using Python, Java, or your language of choice) that processes and correlates incoming data.
Implement algorithms to assign risk scores (e.g., using CVSS scores, frequency of mentions, relevance to your application).
Presentation Layer (Dashboard):

Build a web dashboard using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Alternatively, use Kibana/Grafana if you’re leveraging Elasticsearch for data storage.
4. Develop a Prototype (MVP)
MVP Features:

Ingest data from one or two primary sources.
Normalize and store data in a database.
Implement basic correlation logic and risk scoring.
Create a simple dashboard to display aggregated threat intelligence.
Iterate Based on Feedback:

Test the MVP with real data.
Gather feedback from intended users (e.g., security analysts) and iterate on features.
5. Enhance Security and Operational Aspects
Security:

Ensure your aggregator is secure, especially if it interacts with sensitive threat data.
Implement authentication, authorization, and secure API access.
Monitoring & Alerts:

Integrate alerting systems to notify teams when high-risk vulnerabilities or anomalies are detected.
Set up logging and monitoring to track the system’s performance and data quality.
Scalability:

Consider containerizing your services (Docker, Kubernetes) to handle scale as you add more threat feeds.
6. Documentation and Future Enhancements
Documentation:

Maintain clear documentation on your data schema, integration points, and risk scoring methodologies.
Provide API documentation if you plan to expose any endpoints.
Future Enhancements:

Machine learning for predictive threat analysis.
Integration with existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
Enhanced visualization and reporting features.
